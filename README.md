# Website for the elderly
I my site, I put a lot of emphasis on website design and incorporating special elements such as:
* Animation in the site title
* All the titles and backgrounds images designed in Photoshop and Procreate.
* For sending an email, I added a button that links to the form. Because it would have seemed to me a more correct structure..
